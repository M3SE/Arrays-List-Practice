## Practicing Loops
 

### Fifth Item
- Create a class called "FifthItem" that takes user inputs of strings until the user enters an empty string. Once the user enters an empty string then it tells the user what the fifth string in the list was and the program ends.

### How Large
- Create a class called "HowLarge" that takes user inputs of strings until the user enters an empty string. Once the user enters an empty string then it tells the user how large the list was and the program ends.

### Last Item
- Create a class called "LastItem" that takes user inputs of strings until the user enters an empty string. Once the user enters an empty string then it tells the user what the last string in the list was and the program ends.

### Index Of iteger
- Create a class called "IndexOfInteger" that takes user inputs of integers until the user enters zero. Once the user enters zero then the program tells the user they are done adding integers to the list.

- The program will then ask the user what number they are looking for in the list and tell them the index of that number.

### Sum Of List
- Create a class called "SumOfList"  that takes user inputs of integers until the user enters zero and sums them together.  Create a list in your main method and add as many items as the user would like to the list. Call the method that gets the sums and print the result of the method's calculation to the console (any numeric data type).
